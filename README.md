### Data
Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIhOQV-D-wy-1bBj7obKyLtYuJvzFlyb/view?usp=sharing). The data contains molecule SMILES and their synthetic accessibility derived by Retro* (1 for synthesizable and 0 for not).

This code is used to train classifiers for synthetic accessiblity used for guidance.
